# Trip Prediction Using Uber and Lyft Data in Boston, MA

## Project Objective
This project was created as part of a learning exercise to understand regression concepts with Linear Regression. The main objective was to implement a Linear Regression model and make predictions using Uber and Lyft Dataset in Boston, MA.

## Problem Solved
This project aims to address the following issues:

1. Predict the approximate price for Uber and Lyft rides in Boston, MA.
2. Analyze price patterns for Uber and Lyft rides.

## Background
Uber and Lyft are popular transportation platforms that provide ridesharing services to customers. Analyzing their ride data can provide valuable insights into pricing models and assist in making forecast price predictions.

## Project Outcome
The result of this project is a Linear Regression model that can make predictions of the approximate price of Uber and Lyft rides based on the given input features. In modeling, a linear relationship between the selected features and the target is searched using several metrics, one of which is MAE (mean absolute error). The analysis shows that the difference between MAE train and MAE test is not too far, which means that the model is a good fit. Thus, this model can be used to predict the estimated price of travel with a good level of accuracy.
